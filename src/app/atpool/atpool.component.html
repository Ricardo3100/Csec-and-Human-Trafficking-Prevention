While at the pool Stacy was approached by a strange man who asked her for directions around the corner.
As she provided the directions out of the blue a second man walked up and knocked her out. Stacy eventually woke up to find herself chained up in a small room. She was eventually placed in an unknown home where she would be treated as a slave to raise a family's children and was repeatedly abused until the age of 24 when she sought help.
